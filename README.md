# react-portfolio

## Description

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

This project was created to enhance my comfortability with and to showcase what I have learned thus far with React. 

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
DOM operations are expensive so REACT creates a virtual VDOM which is a respresentation of the page structure in memory, tracking what needs to be updated and only updates those specific things.
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
