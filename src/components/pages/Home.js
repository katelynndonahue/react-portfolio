      <p>
      I am a Web Developer with a background in graphic design, retail
          management and spent a formative year as a longterm substitute science
          teacher in a Catholic high school. I love science, reading, spending
          time with my family and friends,
          <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i>. I
          am a plant mom and hedgehog mom to my angel, Ginger. I love music,
          anything from Led Zeppelin to A Tribe Called Quest and my favorite tv
          shows include:
            <i>New Girl,</i>
            <i>Scrubs,</i>
            and
            <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</i>
      </p>
